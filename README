Sudoku resolver/generator.

Works for sudoku sizes 2x2 2x3 2x4 3x3 3x4 4x4 and maybe more.

That is some code i wrote 5 years ago. Its works, it is very memory efficient, but it really have to be cleaned...

It actually solve then reduce at maximum any sudoku file passed as argument (cf. grids/ subdir).
